It is used to manage Pokémon storage with a Bank, like the Pokébank, but as free service (and a local storage solution).
This homebrew is not intended to cheat (not even cloning). It's just a storage solution!!

What this Homebrew can do:

Navigate through PC boxes from ORAS save.
Navigate through Bank boxes.
Select one Pokémon and move it to another box slot.
Swap a box content to another (pc <-> bank)
Export/Import savedata to/from game (/main).
Load/Save bankdata to/from bank (/pkbank/bank).
Autocomplete Pokédex when transfering Pokémon (OR/AS, may be bugged in X/Y).
Prompt a dialog to save/exit/backup during execution
Work on o3DS AND n3DS!

## How to install:

  <li>Just extract the archive at (to?) the root of you SD Card.</li>
